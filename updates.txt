there is two ways to make the program effective. 
give each teacher three courses

there are 4 T courses
there are 2 M courses
there are 3 W courses
there are 2 G courses

so how can we make the best of that

for T courses: 
we have the following subjects: 
	1. Informatik
	2. Geometry
	3. Analysis
	4. Deutsch LV
	5. Deutsch HV
	6. Physik
	7. Chemie

how about we book each teacher for a course and a subject before we sort. and we create a long 2D array, so that each teacher
has maximum three courses. and then we sort the teacher the same way the teachers do. 

and now... let's see how we will write the code thing

1. start with the first course. 
2. choose the teachers who have the same subject
3. choose a teacher randomly
4. if the teacher has more than two courses, choose another teacher, else create a dictions whose key is the name of the teacher
and the value is the course with his subject in this form "CRS-SUB".
5. repeat this with each course. 
6. print the value of each course with its teachers

sample courses
courses = ["TA1", "TA2", "TF1", "TF2", "MA1", "MF1", "GA1", "GA2", "WA1", "WA2", "WF1"]
teachers = ["vBl" ,"SHA" ,"TAV" ,"MTC" ,"KEM" ,"KRZ" ,"KYF" ,"VOR" ,"WG0" ,"WDR" ,"RI0" ,"OST" ,"RE0" ,"KRO" ,"SCH" ,"SD0" ,"BU0" ,"MSZ"]

num_courses = {}
sub_teacher = {}

for teacher in teachers:
	num_courses[teacher] = 0

for course in courses:
	for subject in course.subjects:
		while True:
			randTeacher = random.choice(selectedTeachers)
			if num_course[randTeacher] < 2:
				sub_teacher[randTeacher] += f"{course}-{subject} "
				num_course[randTeacher] += 1
				break
